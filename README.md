### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I'm Nidhi Shetty.

A Student of Third year B.E. in information technology. 

I began my programming journey by exploring c, c++, java and ended up finding my love and passion for learning python and I wish to dig deeper into the language as much as I can.
